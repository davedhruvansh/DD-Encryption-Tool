üîê Advanced Encryption Tool

The Advanced Encryption Tool is a powerful, browser-based application designed for both learners and professionals in the field of cyber security. It combines the simplicity of classical encryption techniques with the strength of modern cryptography, allowing users to explore how sensitive data can be encrypted and decrypted securely.

This project includes two encryption methods:

Caesar Cipher ‚Äì One of the oldest and simplest methods of encryption, where characters are shifted by a fixed number of positions. It is implemented here to demonstrate the concept of substitution ciphers and help beginners understand the basics of encryption and decryption.

AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) ‚Äì A widely used encryption algorithm in modern security applications. It provides password-protected, strong encryption to ensure that data cannot be accessed without the correct key. AES is the industry standard used by governments, organizations, and security experts worldwide.
